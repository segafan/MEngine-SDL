[-] Code::Blocks port & Linux/Mac OS X port
[-] Refactor
[-] Do the //TODO: stuff in code

[-] Animation class
[-] Improve Align in text drawing

[-] Bitmap fonts
[-] Rework Font Drawing
[?] Create Log types (Error, Info, Message, etc.)
[-] Remove CreateRect and things like this
[-] Log GetRenderFlags()
[-] Try to use const more and static less
[-] Set Texture and music etc. directory and ad it automaticly to file path
[-] Create file containing the images to be loaded like so:
<type> <filepath> <key>
i ./resources/textures/image.png IMAGE
use i for image and a for animation and so on
[-] Create own image format
[-] Better Text Input System
[-] Networking
[-] Add Background Image to GUIButton
[-] Rect Swap() SwapX() SwapY()
[-] Better Camera using Matrices
[-] Touch Input
[-] Joystick Input and Gamepad Input
[-] Add SetLogicalRenderSize()
[-] More TextureManager example: one for tiles, one for buttons, one for player textures etc.
[-] Enable/Disable Camera than drawing
[-] FontManager should contain Fonts which store fonts int multiple sizes
[-] SwapValues()
[-] Enable/Disable relative to camera
[-] Make game engine parts disableable
[?] Serialize Stuff like Textures and fonts and etc. with numbers and #define DIRT_TEXTURE 1 <--- Use it like this beacuse std::vectors are faster than std::map
[?] Create Texture, Music and stuff...
[-] Create Template ResourceManager
[-] Make a #define 2D to use 2D and a 3D to use 3D
[-] Use SFML for Audio (It has audio record built in)
[-] Use SFML for Networking (It's better and easier to use)
[+] Rework PollEvent(Input* input) to input->PollEvent();
[-] Make display->Draw(Shape)
[+] Make Texture.SetAlpha(int alpha)
[-] Create Texture Sections which can load destroy more textures at once ex. Menu Section loads button textures, background than destroys it later
